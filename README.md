# Pause Timer

Some apps, like [Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/2102), make it very difficult to disable autoplay. This app aims to solve that by letting the user create a timer that will pause whatever video or audio is playing. This doesn't precisely solve the problem of stopping playback exactly when the current episode is over (unless you very carefully time it), but it does help prevent the app from playing for hours on end when you fall asleep.
